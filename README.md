Tutorial: Web Application using Java + Play Framework
=================================

_October, 2016_

I put together some videos on how to create a simple web application using Java 8 + Play Framework 2.5.x. You can find the series of videos collected at [http://code.scottshipp.com/tutorial-web-application-using-java-play-framework/](http://code.scottshipp.com/tutorial-web-application-using-java-play-framework/). This repo is the accompanying code, so that you can compare what you come out with against this running version.
